# genv (GPU Environment Management) [![Join the community at (https://discord.gg/zN3Q9pQAuT)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-genv-7289da?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/zN3Q9pQAuT) 

*genv* lets you easily control, configure and monitor the GPU resources that you are using.

It is intendend to ease up the process of GPU allocation for data scientists without code changes 💪🏻

This project was highly inspired by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and other version, package and environment management software like [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## 🔥 Why *genv*?

- Easily share GPUs with your teammates
- Find available GPUs for you to use - on-prem or on cloud via remote access
- Pool the GPUs from multiple machines, allocate the available machine without SSH-ing every one of them
- Switch between GPUs without code changes
- Reserve GPU resources for as long as you use them with no one else hijacking them
- Reproduce your experiment environment easily
- Save time while collaborating

Plus, it's 100% free and gets installed before you can say Jack Robinson.
