GPU Environment Management
==========================

genv is an open-source environment management system for GPUs on Linux.

It was highly inspired by `PyEnv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ and other version, package and environment management software like `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/>`_, `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_, `rbenv <https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv>`_.

genv lets you easily control, configure and monitor the GPU resources that you are using.
